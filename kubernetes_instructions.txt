# KUBERNETES ALL THINGS
POD - IS A group of one ore more containers ,they share storage and network as well
# Generally one pod has one docker container 

 kubectl get all —>get everything in Kubernetes
kubectl get pods
kubectl get pods —show-labels #show label of pods


kubectl apply -f first-pod.yaml. —>creates pod

minikube ip —>gets ip of Minikube 

#pods command
kubectl describe pod pod name
Kubectl describe service service name


kubectl exec nameofpod  ls. —>ls  is the command

Example - kubectl exec webapp ls

Kubectl -it exec webapp sh. — creates interactive shell with Kubernetes pod

Pods are not long running so that’s why they are not exposed on system
#services 
We provide selector while creating service which looks for it on the pod and selects it
Type:ClusterIp — >not exposed to external traffic in service only inside the clusterIP ,service will have an Ip and it would be long-lived

Type :NodePort —>exposing the port to the outside world
kubectl apply -f webapp-service.yaml 

—need to use minikube ip —> command to get the ip and on that ip the service would be running

#for minikube - minikube service service name will open it on browser automatically

 kubectl apply -f .  # apply all the files in the folder


 #Replica sets kubernetes --->

 deleting a pod --> kubectl delete pod podname # all pods -- kubectl delete pod --all
 deleting a service ---> kubectl delete service(svc) servicename
 #how many instances of a pod is running at a particular time ,if there is 
 less than that replica set ,kubernetes will spring up that for us 
 #describing replicaset
 kubectl describe replicaset webapp
  kubectl describe rs webapp
  kubectl delete replicaset replicasetname


  #deployments in kubernetes
  almost same as replicaSet but has rolling deployments
-----------------
  #rollouts
  kubectl rollout status deploy webapp

  kubectl rollout history deploy webapp

  kubectl rollout undo deploy webapp --to-revision=2  # will go back to version 2
